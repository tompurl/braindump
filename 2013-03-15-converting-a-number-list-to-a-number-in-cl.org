#+Title: Converting A Number List To A Number In CL 
#+Date: 2013-03-15 22:17


I spent a while tonight trying to figure this out, and I didn't find
much that helped me, so I thought I would share my solution in case
someone else has this problem.

I'm using *Common Lisp*, and I need to convert a list of numbers into a
concatenated version of that number. So I basically need to convert
=(1 2 3 4)= to =1234= (as a number, not a string).

Here's basically what you have to do:

1. Convert your list into a string
2. Convert your string into a number

The second part is easy - just use the =parse-integer= function.
However, the first part is what was so tricky to a CL beginner. There
isn't a built-in function that I could find to perform that conversion,
so I created the following function:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/tompurl/5174818.js"></script>
#+END_HTML

I hope this helps out a few other Common Lisp newbies.
