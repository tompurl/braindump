#+TITLE:  Setting Up A Pocketmine Server

I'm writing this as of 11/22/15. At this time, the stable version of Minecraft
PE (MCPE) (0.13.x) does not work with the stable (1.4) or development (1.6)
versions [[https://www.pocketmine.net/|Pocketmine]] due to protocol issues. 
The version of Pocketmine that you need is 1.7, and you have to go to yet
another third party to get that. 

Here's how I got it working on my Debian Jessie system. First install the
"development" version of Pocketmine like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/sbin - DON'T use root
    $ mkdir pocketmine && cd pocketmine
    $ wget -q -O pocketmine.bin http://get.pocketmine.net/ - Please don't pipecurl
    $ bash ./pocketmine.bin -v development
    $ ./start.sh
    - Go through the installation wizard
    - Hit Ctrl-C after the app launches
#+END_EXAMPLE

At this point you have to download a new =PocketMine-MP.phar= file. The 1.7
files are available here:

- http://pocketmine.minedox.com/

I ended up downloading [[https://github.com/ImagicalCorp/PocketMine-0.13.0/blob/master/releases/PocketMine-MP_1.7dev%2339.phar?raw=true|build -39]]. 

Once you're done with all of that execute these commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ cd pocketmine
    - Your source file name may be different
    $ cp ~/Downloads/PocketMine-MP_1.7dev\-39.phar ./PocketMine-MP.phar
    $ ./start.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

In your MCPE client you should also see the protocol number under the number of
users on the server, which in my case is *0.13.0*.
