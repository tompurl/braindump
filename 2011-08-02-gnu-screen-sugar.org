#+Title: GNU Screen Sugar 

I don't usually advertise [[http://github.com/tompurl][my Github
projects]] on this blog, but I thought that this one might actually be
kinda useful to you if you like
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen][GNU Screen]]: -
[[https://github.com/tompurl/scrugar][tompurl/Scrugar]]

Basically, it's a couple of functions and aliases that I use to make it
easier to use Screen. A few of my friends have found them to be pretty
useful, so I decided to share them.
