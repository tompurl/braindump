#+TITLE: LUG Meeting Notes - 4/22/16

#+DATE: 2016-04-22

I had a great time at the
[[http://www.meetup.com/FoxValleyLUG/events/230397028/][Fox Valley Linux
User Group meeting]] this month. This month's topic was "talk about
whatever" and I picked up a lot of great knowledge. Also, two new people
attended the meeting and a couple of newbies came back.

I took some fractured notes and collected some URL's. Please note that
this list below is not intended to be very verbose or complete - if you
really want to be part of the conversation you'll just have to attend
next month :-)

* Installation

-  [[http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/][The rEFInd Boot Manager]]

   -  This is a nice looking tool for multi-booting with modern
      EFI-enabled motherboards.

* Programming / Scripting

-  [[https://www.codecademy.com/][Learn to code | Codecademy]]

   -  Jason said that this is a nice, *free* resource for learning about
      Python programming.

-  [[https://blogs.windows.com/ie/2013/01/31/introducing-modern-ie-testing-sites-for-internet-explorer-made-easier/][Introducing
   modern.IE -- Testing sites for Internet Explorer made easier |
   Exploring IE]]

   -  This is a site that shows you how to easily set up a virtual
      machine running a free (for 30 days) Windows virtual machine so
      you can test your web application with IE.

-  [[https://gist.github.com/andreptb/57e388df5e881937e62a][Setup
   modern.ie vagrant boxes]]

   -  This shows you how to do the modern.IE thing with Vagrant.

* Networking

   · jimradford/superputty Wiki]]

* Text Editors

There seems to be a ton of free Chrome and Javascript-based text editors
out there now. Here's the ones that I heard about during the meeting:

-  [[http://brackets.io/][Brackets - A modern, open source code editor
   that understands web design.]]
-  [[https://atom.io/][Atom]]
-  [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][Visual Studio Code - Code Editing.
