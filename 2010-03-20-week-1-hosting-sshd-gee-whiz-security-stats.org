Title: Week 1 Hosting SSHD - Gee Whiz Security Stats Tags:

I installed the
[[http://www.freebsd.org/releases/8.0R/announce.html][8.0 version of
FreeBSD]] this week in a VirtualBox image, and I thought that it would
be fun to let some of my friends use it as a web server test bed.  I
therefore setup an SSH server and hardened it using some of the
recommendations from this web page: -
[[http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/SecuringSSH][Securing OpenSSH]]

Specifically, I set the following properties: - *I explicitly turned off
root logins.* This is the default on FreeBSD, and it should be the
default on *every* Linux and Unix server (even though it isn't). - *I
deny access to anyone using the SSH 1 protocol*. - *I turned off
password* *authentication*.  Instead, anyone who logs in has to use
[[http://sial.org/howto/openssh/publickey-auth/][keypair
authentication]].

With all of these settings, I feel like my SSH server is safe enough. 
However, I was curious to see if anyone had actually tried to crack it. 
I mean, it's only been up for 3 days.  The bad robots of the Internet
could not have possibly found my little SSH garden in the shade, right?
A quick look at /var/log/auth.log brings me back to Earth.  To my
surprise, their have already been hundreds of attempted logins from
multiple sources.  Here's the statistics related to people who are
trying to crack my SSH server.  Remember, this server is 3-days old. -
*865*failed login attempts - *281*unique login names - Some of the names
are fairly comical (12345?), and many of them are very uncommon
(Agatha?).

-  *0*login attempts using the*root* user name.

   -  This was a big surprise for me.

-  The attacks originated from *6* IP addresses.

   -  It's anyone's guess if all of these computers are part of the same
      botnet or if there are multiple groups trying to crack my server.

I can't help but compare any publicly-available, networked service to a
car that is parked in the middle of a city containing a billion people. 
No matter how small and obscure your car is, you can't afford to park it
without locking your doors.
