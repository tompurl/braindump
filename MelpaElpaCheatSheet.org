Melpa hsa a very nice interface for finding and managing plugins. You
can open it with the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

M-x list-packages

#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you're in that buffer you can manipulate packages with these
commands:

- =i= - Mark for installation
- =u= - Unmark
- =d= - Mark for deletion
- =x= - Execute the installation or deletion of packages
- =r= - Refresh the list
