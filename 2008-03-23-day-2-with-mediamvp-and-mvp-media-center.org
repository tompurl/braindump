#+Title: Day 2 With MediaMVP and MVP Media Center 

I noodled around with my
[[http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_mediamvp.html][MVP]]/[[http://www.mvpmc.org][MVPMC]]
setup a little bit more, and discovered the following: 1. Live-TV with
my [[http://www.mythtv.org][MythTV]] backend actually works pretty well.
I just needed to fix my timezone settings. 2. VLC transcoding, which
allows me to view Xvid AVI's using MVP, is a pretty CPU-intensive
process. The default video quality level (labled "DVD") used about 95%
of the CPU cycles of my 1.6 Ghz Sempron 3100+. I ended up using the
"SVCD" video quality level, which is still pretty good, and only uses
about 65% of my CPU cycles.

That's it for now. Soon, I hope to have everything set up properly so I
can share some of the details that might matter to someone considering
the MVP, such as the following: - network topology - configuration -
total costs
