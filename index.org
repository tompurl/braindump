Hi! My name is *Tom Purl* I like to create fun things and then write
about them. 

* For Example...

  :CUSTOM_ID: For Example

- Here's my [[file:blog-archive.org][blog archive]]. This is my preferred way of being "social"
  on the internet :-)
- My code and such on [[https://github.com/tompurl][Github]]
- My screencasts on [[https://vimeo.com/user3972465][Vimeo]]
- My [[file:braindump.org][braindump]], which is is where I keep a lot of rough, informal
  notes. If it was 2004 I would call this a personal wiki.
- And the [[https://twitter.com/tompurl][tweets]] that I write every time I forget why I don't use
  Twitter.
