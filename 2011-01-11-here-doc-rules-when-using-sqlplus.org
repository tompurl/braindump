Title: "Here Doc" Rules When Using SQL Plus Tags:
linux,shell-scripting,unix Category: Tutorial Comments: true

I've been writing a lot of shell scripts lately, and usually they have
included a
[[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Here_doc][here doc]]
that invokes Oracle's
[[http://www.oracle.com/technology/docs/tech/sql_plus/index.html][SQL*Plus
program]].  Here docs can be very nice, but they can also be fairly
flaky. You have to remember a bunch of strange rules when you write them
or they will simply break with cryptic error messages.

I therefore created a list of *here doc rules* that I paste into every
shell script that uses one.  Of course, this is a foolish way of
recording knowledge, so I thought it might be useful to save them in my
blog instead. Unfortunately, I've had to learn almost all of these rules
myself the hard way, which sometimes involves banging my head against my
desk until I gain some form of clarity :).  I hope my list helps others
avoid this sort of frustration:

1. Don't put "exit" in either the here doc or the sql script

   -  *Exit* is a keyword in the shell, so using it in a here doc can
      cause lots of strange problems.

2. Use tabs, not spaces

   -  More than once, I've been stuck on a here doc problem only to
      realize that this actually makes a difference.

3. Don't put a tab in front of the last line.

   -  A lot of online tutorials show a tab in front of the last line,
      but it has *never* worked for me.

4. Do *NOT* put a space after the last line in the here doc.  That will
   also break your script.

   -  This rule probably took me the most time to discover.

Remember, if you don't follow these rules, your shell script will do
very strange things.  You have been warned :)
