Here's the steps that I go through when writing and publishing a new
blog post using Pelican.

* Article Creation And Editing

First, I create a new branch of the git repo for the new article:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code

git branch some-new-article
git checkout some-new-article

#+END_SRC

Please note that the branch name above is arbitrary.

I then create my new article and edit it. To view the article in 
a web browser I simply navigate to the Pelican root directory and
execute this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code

make html && (cd ./output && python -m pelican.server)

#+END_SRC

Once I'm happy with the article I commit it into the
=some-new-article= branch.

* Publishing

Next, I switch back to the =master= branch and merge it with
my =some-new-article= branch:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code

git checkout master
git merge some-new-article

#+END_SRC

I can now publish my new article on the public internet:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code

make rsync_upload

#+END_SRC

* Cleaning Up

Once I'm completely done with the new article, I can clean up the
non-master branch like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code

git branch -d some-new-article

#+END_SRC
