It's unlike me to upgrade my systems very often since it can take so
much time, but I was moved recently to upgrade both my "server" (to
[[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] 9.04) and my EEE PC 900 (to
[[http://www.geteasypeasy.org/][Easy Peasy]] 1.5). In general, I'm very
impressed with how much better Linux-on-the-desktop gets every 6 months,
and I look forward to at least another 8 years as a happy desktop Linux
user. One of the great things about Ubuntu is that it really is just
painless to set up some pretty sophisticated servers. For example, I use
my Ubuntu server to record television shows using
[[http://www.mythtv.org/][MythTv]], which can be /very/ difficult to
install. However, using the Ubuntu packages, I was able to get my system
up-and-running in less than 10 minutes. I do have one very small
criticism of Ubuntu, and it's that they keep making it harder and harder
to install [[http://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg]] from source. The "stock"
version of ffmpeg that comes with Ubuntu can't do a lot of cool things
like convert videos to the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC][H264]] format, so one
of the first things that I usually do after installing Ubuntu is compile
a more robust version of that application. Well, the process I used to
compile it in 8.04 definitely did /not/ work with 9.04 for some strange
reason. Thank goodness that I found
[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095][this tutorial]],
which made things very simple. One really great thing about the 1.5
version of Easy Peasy is that I can now use some
[[http://www.compiz-fusion.org/][Compiz]] effects with my EEE PC 900.
Previous versions of Easy Peasy didn't even allow me to turn Compiz on.
Hooray for tons tap-dancing sprites on my screen! Here are some of the
resources that I used to set up my Ubuntu 9.04 and Easy Peasy 1.5
systems. Maybe someone else will find them to be useful: -
