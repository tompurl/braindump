* Notes

** Sprites

- There's a one-to-many relationship between "programs" and sprites. 
- Ideally, you want to have a very small number of sprites and use a lot of
  costumes.
- You have to "hide" sprites that you don't want to see on a particular
  backdrop.
- You can make fine-tuned property changes for a sprite by clicking on the blue
  "i" that is next to the sprite in the sprite box.

** Programs

- A "program" seems to be a thread of execution.
- Typically it's started by clicking on the green flag.
- It appears that each sprite and backdrop can have its own programs, and that
  each of these can have more than one program.

** Code

- You can share code and other things by putting them in your "backpack".
