My rating: [[http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/99545559][3 of 5
stars]] This book is a fascinating account of the history of the
telegraph and how it changed the world. If you are a history and
technology buff, you will definitely get a lot out of this book. Please
don't be fooled by the title, however. This book does not make deep
comparisons between the histories of the internet and the telegraph. A
small chapter at the end of the book provides the only comparison
between the two technologies. Even with this flaw, this is a solid
technical history book, and I really feel like I gained a lot of
perspective.
