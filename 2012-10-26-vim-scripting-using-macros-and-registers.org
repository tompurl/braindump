#+Title: Vim Scripting Using Macros And Registers 
#+Date: 2012-10-26 19:50

I recently discovered how easy it was to basically "convert" macros into
mappings in my =.vimrc=, and I thought that information was terribly
useful to most Vim users, so I tried to write a blog about it.

However, I soon discovered that the best and fastest way to explain this
awesome feature was to create a screencast. So here it is:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/52310701?badge=0" width="500" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> 
  <p>
#+END_HTML

Vim Scripting Using Macros and Registers from Tom Purl on Vimeo.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </p>
#+END_HTML

Like I said in the screencast, this is a "quick" overview of a lot of
awesome features in Vim. It's designed to whet your appetite, not be a
complete tutorial. However, I am more than happy to answer any questions
in the comments.

Also, please note that I have not created many screencasts before. Any
constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!
