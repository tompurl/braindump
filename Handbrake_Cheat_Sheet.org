#+TITLE: Handbrake Cheat Sheet

* Flipping Videos 180 Degrees

As of 6/13/17, this only appears to work in the CLI version of
Handbrake, not the GUI version.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
HandBrakeCLI -i ./orig.mp4 -o ./flipped.mp4 --preset="Android Tablet" --rotate
#+END_SRC

The "rotate" value defaults to "3", which means 180 degrees. Also,
please note that this command re-encodes the video using the "Android
Tablet" profile.
