* Details
** Exodus
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Exodus
   :END:

*** Overview

So far this is my favorite wallet because it's so easy to install and
my wallets can be restored from a seed phrase. This makes it really
easy to back things up in a secure way while also being very easy to
restore.

It's no Electrum, but as of 1/2018, it my favorite wallet for storage
of Ethereum.

*** Pros

- Very easy to install, and it runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.
- It works with every currency I care about.

*** Cons

- Closed source
- Doesn't allow me to run a cold wallet.
- Requires a network connection. I therefore can't use it on an
  air-gapped machine.

** MetaMask
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: MetaMask
   :END:

*** Overview

You can't really use Ethereum these days without using MetaMask at
some point. It's a requirement for Cryptokitties and it's by far the
best "light", open-source wallet available. 

My only beef with it is accessible by every web site that you visit. 
Also, it has to run within a web browser process. So there is a very 
large attack surface there. Also, I still don't know how to encrypt
my keys on disk if I wanted to.

So security is scary, but usability and transparency are excellent. 
I'll try not to keep too much Ether in this wallet.
** Mist
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Mist
   :END:
*** Overview

I like that this is the default wallet, but I really don't like that I
need a full copy of the blockchain to use it. I've been waiting for
over 4 days to sync and it's a royal pain.

Also, it doesn't seem to offer a seed phrase to backup your private key.
This may be a deal-breaker for me.

** MyEthereumWallet (MEW)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: MyEthereumWallet
   :END:
*** Overview
This looks like the easiest tool to use with the most security
gotchas. Apparently you can avoid some of these issues by running a
local, static copy of the code but it still makes me feel like I'm
walking on eggshells.

It's appealing to me because I can apparently use it on an air-gapped
Tails system, but it seems to be very picky about the version of Tails
I can use. The latest version as of 1/3/2018 has issues for example,
and it's difficult to download older versions of Tails that *do*
supposedly work.

** Jaxx
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Jaxx
   :END:

This is very similar to Exodus, only slightly harder to use. It also
appears to have features that Exodus does not, but not anything that I
think I would need.
