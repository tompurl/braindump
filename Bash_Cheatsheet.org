** Run Script In Debug Mode From The Command Line
   When testing a script it's nice to print every command that's being
   executed to STDOUT so you can "debug" your script and see *exactly*
   what's happening. 

   One way of doing this (and what I've regrettably always done) is
   add this line to the top of my script during a debug session:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
set -x
#+END_SRC

   This works well but you need to edit the script every time you want
   to turn this feature on and off. Wouldn't it be nice if you could run
   your script in "debug mode" without making any changes to it?

   This is deceptively simple in Bash (or basically any shell). Simply
   run your command like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# No debug
./my_script.sh

# Yes debug :-)
bash -x ./my_script.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Here all you're doing is starting a new, separate Bash shell and
   setting the options.
