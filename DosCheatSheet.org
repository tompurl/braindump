#+TITLE: DOS Cheat Sheet

* Miscellania

- Get a pipe to server
  - =net use \\server - /user:domain\username=
- Map drive
  - =net use - \\server\share=
- Query username based on sid
  - =net user r003988 /domain=
- Delete every Vim swap file recursively
  - =del /AH /s -.swp=
- Control remote Windows services
  - =sc \\server query|start|stop service_short_name=
  - --Note--: =psservice= (from sysinternals) seems to do a better job of this
- xcopy
  -  Copy a directory
    - =xcopy /E /I sourcedir destdir=

* Stupid Psexec Tricks

- rebooting a remote computer:
  - =psexec \\hostname -u fooad\someid shutdown -r -f=
  - This is especially useful when you're logged into domain A but need to remotely reboot a computer in domain B (since the shutdown remote option does not support passing user credentials).

* For Loop Fun

** Add only new files to an svn repository

- =for /f "tokens=- delims=" %f in ('svn status ^| find "?" ^| find "gtd\wiki" ^| c:\gawk\bin\gawk "{print $2}"') do svn add %f=

- My main command has to have the following properties:
  - It has to be wrapped in parentheses and single quotes
  - You have to make the pipes and redirect signs into literals using the caret.

* openssl

Here's how you can encrypt some text on the fly from a DOS prompt:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    more| openssl enc -e -des3 -base64 -pass pass:somepass
    foobar de roobarb and something secret
    <F6><ENTER>
#+END_EXAMPLE

And here's how you decrypt the output:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    more| openssl enc -d -des3 -base64 -pass pass:somepass
    U2FsdGVkX194WrTjuO7eTpWiWV5F93dRATH1TgZlw23EwELBz6GCSjkU5q3ZTqRi
    Kz+YX4CLs4duz8d51ctlGw==
    <F6><ENTER>
#+END_EXAMPLE
