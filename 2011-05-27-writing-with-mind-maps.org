#+Title: Writing With Mind Maps 

I've been using mind maps to help me collect my ideas for a couple of
years now and I find them to be an invaluable tool. I use them at home
and work to do things like create document outlines, plan projects, and
brainstorm ideas.

However, it always surprises me to see that very few other people use
them. I therefore decided to put together a small tutorial on creating
mind maps. I hope that it helps a few other people :)

** What's A Mind Map?

A mind map is a visualization of a brain dump. Sound weird? Here's what
I mean. Often, when we are thinking about a big idea (e.g. how will I
write this essay, should I pursue this business opportunity, etc.), we
have lots of related ideas floating around in our heads. Trying to
evaluate and flesh-out all of these ideas in our heads can be very
difficult. First, focusing on one idea for a long time can cause you to
forget about the other ideas. Second, it's often hard to see the big
picture as your big idea gets bigger and bigger.

So it helps if you can actually write all of these ideas down and
organize them. The problem is that, in the US, we are trained to do this
will a bulleted list. It's still better than not writing down your
ideas, but the format is not very conducive to organizing lots of
little, loosely-related pieces of information.

*Mind maps* are a much better tool. They allow you to do the following:

-  Record your ideas
-  Show how the ideas are related in a simple, lightweight and intuitive
   way
-  See the big picture of your big idea.

So why would you need to use something like this? Here's a few examples:

-  Brainstorming Session (either by yourself or with a group)
-  Writing

   -  Mind maps are a *great*way to gather and organize information for
      an outline.

** Mini-Tutorial

Ok, so how do you do it? Here's a quick example. Let's assume that you
wanted to write a blog about a great new recipe that you invented. You
don't know what to include and you don't want to miss any important
ideas, so you decide to create a mind map.

First, you need some way of recording your mind map. Some of the most
useful mind maps that I have every created have been done with a piece
of paper and a pencil. However, if I get a choice, I prefer using a
program called [[http://www.xmind.net/][Xmind]]. There's a free version
that is very powerful and easy to use.

Next, you need a *main idea*. This is the idea that is at the center of
all of your other ideas. In this example, the main idea would be
something like “Pulled Pork Blog Recipe”. You would then record your
idea in your mind map like this:

#+CAPTION: Main idea

[[|filename|images/main_idea.png]]
Next, you'll want to create some *sub-nodes*or *subtopics*. These are
simply “child” nodes of the main idea. Here's an example of what you may
user for a blog article:

#+CAPTION: Main idea with subnodes

[[|filename|images/main_idea-with-subnodes.png]]
This is the “model” that you can now use to organize your thoughts. As
you can see, it's basically a stream of conciousness. Your version of
this map would probably look a little different. So now you can just
create child nodes of the child nodes and let your mind wander. Here's
an example of a complete mind map that you might use for this type of
blog:

#+CAPTION: example 1

[[|filename|images/pulled-pork-blog-recipe-example1.png]]
This format may seem a little strange to you, but that's ok. Most of the
time, mind maps will only be used by the owner, so they only have to
make sense to the owner. So use the structure and format that works best
for you. Ok, so now you have a complete mind map. What can you do with
it?

-  *Document*: If the goal was to publish a document, then the mind map
   could either be that document or help you create that document. For
   example, you could use the *outline* node in the example above to
   help you write a blog .
-  *Decision*: Sometimes, the only thing that is “created” by a mind map
   is a decision. For example, I once had an idea for creating a web
   application that I would run as a side business. When the idea was in
   my head, it seemed great. However, once I got all of my ideas down
   into a mind map, it was clear to me that this idea had been done
   before and that the market was already saturated.

** More On Formatting

Chances are that your mind is “wired” a little differently than anyone
else's mind. And since a mind map is usually a brain dump, your
structure and format will be unique.

So in other words, don't sweat the format :) Besides, if you are using a
program like Xmind to create your map, then you have the freedom to move
your nodes around if change your mind about the structure.

One final note on formatting. If you are creating a document that has to
be published, then it probably isn't a mind map, even if you use a
mind-mapping tool like Xmind to create it. Mind maps are great for
*creating documents and ideas, not for communicating with large groups
of people*.

      mind-mapping. Feel free to take a look!

   -  There are loads of non-free mind-mapping tools, but I've never
      used one so I can't comment on them.

      mind maps that users have uploaded. Check it out if you want to
