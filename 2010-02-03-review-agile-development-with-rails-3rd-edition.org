My rating: [[http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/83471614][4 of 5
stars]] In general, this book does a fairly good job of helping you
create a rails-based application. Part 3 includes some great in-depth
information on the topics that are briefly discussed in Part 2. I only
have one real gripe about this book. It packs in lots of topics (e.g. db
theory, AJAX, unit testing, security, deployment), but it doesn't really
tell you much about them. Therefore, if you have a problem, then good
luck figuring it out using the content in the book. A good example is
the final chapter which covers deployment. The chapter devotes only a
few small paragraphs to configuring Apache for passenger. To me, this
section was completely useless unless you were already an expert with
Apache configuration. I ended that chapter with a broken Apache server
and no resources (from the book) to begin fixing it. Another problem
that I had with that chapter is that it really didn't follow the pattern
that the chapters in Part 2 used. In those chapters, the authors would
should you how to do something relatively small, show you how to test
it, and then provide some troubleshooting information if the task was
particularly complex. The deployment chapter gave you a *very brief and
generalized* tutorial in each section, and then just assumed that
everything went perfectly. It didn't show you how to test anything, and
it didn't help you troubleshoot any possible problems. Don't get me
wrong. I know that no book will provide all of the information that I
would ever need about a subject, and thank goodness for the internet in
these situations. I was just hoping that all of the chapters in a book
that I actually bought would provide better information than some
person's blog. So in general, I guess I would have to say that this was
a very good book with some bad chapters that were tacked-on at the end.
