#+Title: Stupid Unix Tricks - Creating A Self-Updating Dashboard 

Have you ever wanted to automatically run the same command every 5, 10,
or 60 seconds on a Unix/Linux machine until the output changed? For
example, let's say that you're deploying a new application on top of a
[[http://tomcat.apache.org][Tomcat]] app server. After starting Tomcat
and deploying your application, it can take a couple of minutes before
the application is really available.  However, you want to know
/exactly/ when the new version of the application is usable (give or
take 10 seconds).

A good way of testing whether the application is really "up" is to ping
a URL.  You can do this using a web browser, but this approach has a few
disadvantages.  First, it's a manual,  tedious process.  Second, web
browsers can be a little flaky sometimes. For example, they may cache
your last results, giving you incorrect results.

For me, I get much better results testing this sort of thing with curl. 
Here's an example of how you could test the availability of the Hello
World application that comes with Tomcat 6.x:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body bgcolor="white">
    <a href="../helloworld.html">
    <img src="../images/code.gif" height=24 width=24 align=right border=0 alt="view code"></a>
    <a href="../index.html">
    <img src="../images/return.gif" height=24 width=24 align=right border=0 alt="return"></a>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is fine, but it can also very labor-intensive and tedious to
execute the same command over and over.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could
just create an ad-hoc "dashboard" for this command? Here's how you can
do it.  All we have to do is a little shell magic:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ while true; do curl http://localhost:8080/examples/servlets/servlet/HelloWorldExample; sleep 10; done
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here's what I'm doing:

-  First, I'm creating an infinite while loop.  You'll see why this
   isn't a bad idea in a second.
-  Next, I'm running our curl command.
-  After that, I'm sleeping for 10 seconds.  This is very important,
   because you don't want to command to execute multiple times a second
   in an infinite loop.

This loop will repeat itself forever until you kill it with a Ctrl-C.
And here's my results (assuming that I just restarted the server and it
took that servlet 20 seconds to respond):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    curl: (7) couldn't connect to host # First execution
    curl: (7) couldn't connect to host # second
    <html>                             # Success!
    <head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body bgcolor="white">
    <a href="../helloworld.html">
    <img src="../images/code.gif" height=24 width=24 align=right border=0 alt="view code"></a>
    <a href="../index.html">
    <img src="../images/return.gif" height=24 width=24 align=right border=0 alt="return"></a>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Ta-da!  Easy, automatic command testing.  Of course, you can use this
trick with commands other than curl.  It's very handy in any situation
where you want to check a command for a change in output.
