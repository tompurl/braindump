I was getting the error listed above when I was trying to add a printer
via the CUPS web interface. Everything /should/ have worked - my user
was in the lpadmin group and my config file looked good. However, every
time I clicked on the "Add Printer" button, the following would happen:

1. I would get a login dialog
2. I would enter my normal user id and password
3. I would then see the error above in the cups error file

Nothing I found was helpful for weeks, so today I tried something that
/shouldn't/ have made a difference - I simply changed my password. After
that, it was smooth sailing.

Seriously - that's it. Just changed my password. Please don't ask me why
or how that affected anything. However I am glad that I can finally use
my Raspberry Pi as a print server again.

I hope that a few other people who may be pulling their hair out can
find this blog post.
