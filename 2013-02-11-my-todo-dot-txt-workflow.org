What I do every day

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # Create +Everyday tasks
    $ cdt
    01 Read email +Everyday
    02 Read RSS +Everyday
    03 Read Twitter +Everyday

    # This is your morning checklist. Display that checklist:
    $ todo ls +Everyday
    01 Read email +Everyday
    02 Read RSS +Everyday
    03 Read Twitter +Everyday

    # Punch into tasks
    $ punch.py in 1
    # This also puts that ask in my tmux task bar at the bottom of the screen.

    # When done, punch out:
    $ punch.py out
    # Rinse and repeat for the rest of your +Everyday tasks

    # Scrub the @today context from your tasks
    $ scrub

    # Look at all of your tasks:
    $ todo ls
    04 Open ticket with vendor
    05 Something that adds no value
    06 Open change record

    # Add the @today context to everything that you would like to accomplish today:
    $ todo append 4 @today
    $ todo append 6 @today

    # Look at all of your @today tasks:
    $ todo ls @today
    04 Open ticket with vendor @today
    06 Open change record @today

    # Prioritize if you would like
    $ todo pri 6 a
    04 (A) Open ticket with vendor @today
    $ todo pri 6 b
    06 (B) Open change record @today

    # Do the same punch in/out thing for your @today tasks

    # Create some handy-dandy aliases to make things that much easier
