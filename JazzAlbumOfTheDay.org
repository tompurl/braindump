#+TITLE: Jazz Album Of The Day

* Overview

Every day I try to listen to a Jazz album all of the way through. Usually, I
try to listen to something new, but that's not always the case.

        - Very good example of late fifties hard bop
    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMWPR1RwJ-0|Soultrane]] by John Coltrane
        - This is one of the more accessible John Coltrane albums

    - [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSL7VP2gNLUxAPdsAn1edZ880v_muG4bs|Underground]] by the -Thelonious Monk Quartet- 
        - Believe it or not, this is my first T. Monk album. I was drawn to the album by the cover, which may be one of the best I've ever seen.
        - Definitely worth listening to, but I don't know how good it is compared to any of his other stuff. I'll have to remedy that soon.
