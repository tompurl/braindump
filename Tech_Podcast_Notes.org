*** Episode Notes
    - Adam Bertram is a testing expert and author, especially using MS tools.
      - He wrote [[https://leanpub.com/pesterbook][The Pester Book]]
    - Unit Testing philosophy
      - Let's assume that you have a function that creates a 50 GB
        LUN. You would unit test the function's ability to pass the
        value of 50 to the tool that creates the LUN and avoid
        actually creating the LUN.
    - "Testing is a pyramid"
      1. *Bottom*: Unit tests
      2. *Middle*: Integration / Functional tests
	 - Integrate the code with the environment.
	 - Did your function actually create a 50 GB LUN?
      3. *Top*: Acceptance tests
	 - Holistic testing
	 - Am I actually providing a service to my clients?
	 - Is the service that requires that LUN working properly?
    - Writing a full test suite takes twice as much time as writing
      the actual code.
      - Prioritize
    - "Unit tests are like backups"
      - They take lots of work
      - You don't see the value immediately
      - You're really happy to have them eventually.
    - Testing forces you to write your code in a more modular way.
