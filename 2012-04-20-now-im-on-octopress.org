I just finished porting my Jekyll-based blog to
[[http://octopress.org][Octopress]]. Octopress it a really slick layer
built on top of Jekyll that makes it even easier to start blogging with
a static site generator.

I've made a few /very/ small modifications. If you would like to see
them, then you can look at my source here:
