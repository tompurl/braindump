Just a quick housekeeping for those of you who have subscribed to my
blog.

I just started using *Feed Burner* to host my RSS feed. If you like to
keep up with mys, then this means the following:

-  If you *already subscribed to my site* using a feed reader (like
   [[http://reader.google.com][Google Reader]]), then you need to start
   using my [[http://feeds.feedburner.com/TomPurlsWebSite][new feed
   address]].
-  You can now
   [[http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=TomPurlsWebSite&loc=en_US][subscribe
   to my site via email]].
