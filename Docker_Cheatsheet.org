** Location of most Docker-related "data"
   =C:\ProgramData\Docker=
** "Nuking" a container that just won't die
   I've experienced containers before that *just won't die*, even after a reboot,
   even after asking it nicely 200 times. So here's how I've fixed this in the past,
   YMMV.

   1. Grab the hash of your running container using the following command:
      1. =docker ps --no-trunc=
   2. Stop the Docker daemon (called "Docker Desktop" for some reason).
   3. Navigate to the following directory:
      1. =c:\ProgramData\Docker\containers\=
   4. Find the folder with the same name as the hash of your container and delete it.
   5. Start the Docker Desktop.
