Title: Using My Creative Zen With Ubuntu 9.04 Tags:

I've been using an 8 GB
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_ZEN][Creative Zen]] player now
for about a year, and in general, I'm very happy. It was about 25%
cheaper than a comparable iPod, it can do more stuff, and it has ended
up being very durable and easy-to-use.

Another thing that I initially liked about the Zen was how well it
worked with [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] Linux 8.04. From
[[http://amarok.kde.org/][Amarok]], I could add and manage files as
easily as I could with my old iPod. Then I updated my OS to use Ubuntu
9.04. The Zen would mount automatically when you plugged it in, but I
couldn't access it using any music player such as Amarok, RhythmBox, or
Banshee. And if I could access the player using one of those apps, the
connection was always very flaky. I might be able to move one or two
songs, but eventually, something would crash and I would have to start
over again. This thread on the Ubuntu forums shows that many other Zen
users were having the same problem:

The basic advice was to unmount the Zen after it was automatically
mounted, and /then/ access it using your favorite music player. This
only worked for me sporadically at first. And if that wasn't weird
enough, the Amarok maintainers decided to do the following:

-  Completely change the Amarok GUI interface
-  Completely change the way you copy music to an MP3 player.

I figured almost everything out eventually, so I thought I would share
it here.

1. First, *plug your Zen* into your computer. You should now see a Zen
   icon on your desktop.

2. Next, right-click on that icon and choose the *Unmount* *Volume*
   option. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it's what you need to
   do.
3. Next, open Amarok. If you don't see the Amarok window after a minute,
   then look for the *howling wolf* icon in your task tray. You will
   need to right-click on it and choose *Restore*.

   -  *Note*: This process may work with other music players, but I
      haven't tested it.

4. After Amarok opens, you should see the following items in Amarok:

   1. An MP3 player icon with a *red X and green +* next to it.

      -  [[|filename|images/zen-plus.jpg]]

   2. Your Zen listed on the left-hand side of the screen.

      -  [[|filename|images/zen-list1.jpg]]

   3. If you don't see it at first, then make sure that you have clicked
      on the *Collection* button on the left-hand side of the screen.
   4. Also, If you see the MP3 player icon but your player isn't listed
      on the left-hand side of the screen, then *click on the green +
      button*.

Now you can copy individual songs from your *Local Collection* by
right-clicking on a song or album and choosing *Copy To Collection ->
Creative Zen*. That should do it. I've had pretty good luck with this
system as long as I didn't try to move over 6 albums' worth of MP3's at
once. And here are some of the differences that you need to get used to
when using the 2.x version of Amarok:

-  *You can no longer copy playlists over to your Zen.* This is a big
   disappointment to me, and I can't figure out why the Amarok
   maintainers took this functionality away.
-  *You can no longer "queue" up MP3's that you want to copy to your Zen
   and then copy them all over at once.*Again, another great feature
   that was taken away for some mysterious reason.
-  *Album covers are no longer copied to your Zen*. This isn't a huge
   disappointment, but it was always a nice feature of the pre-2.x
   version of Amarok.

In the end, I'm very appreciative that Canonical, the Gnome group, and
the Amarok maintainers provide such excellent software that makes my
life so much more enjoyable. And I'm glad that I finally figured out a
somewhat-reliable process for copying MP3's from my hard drive to my
Zen.
