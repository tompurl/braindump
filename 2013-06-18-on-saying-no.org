Title: On Saying No Date: 2013-06-18 18:40 Comments: true Tags: Status:

I'm a systems administrator for a living, and I'm often on the receiving
end of strange requests. For example, I once worked on a system that
took time-sensitive requests and routed them agents who could act on
then.

The problem was that the requests, which originated from external
parties, were sent to us using *email*. Email is a great way to send
jokes to your friends, but it's a terrible messaging provider. Not only
is delivery isn't guaranteed, but your messages can go through dozens of
external hops and filters before they reach their target, which can
swallow or alter your message. In general, if what you want to say has
to get there *and* be accurate, email is really a very poor choice.

So what should I say when someone asks me how we should implement this
high-level design?

What I've been heard in the past from some managers and tech columnists
is that you should *never* say no. Always say "yes, and...". As in "yes,
we can do this, and we'll add XYZ software and hardware to the system to
make sure that the issues with this design are mitigated.".

And this sounds great in a meeting. Everyone is cooperating and no hard
decisions are being made. The business partners will go back to their
desks and say "wow, I love working with Tom on projects. He's great!"

But there's one problem. I can't make email from an external system
reliable. No matter how friendly or helpful or hard-working I am, I
simply can't ensure that your Gmail message will arrive as intended. I
can't bend reality, and I simply can't control all of the things that
are out of my control.

What this means to my employer is that when I say "yes, but..." I'm not
doing my job. Not only am I not doing my job, I'm actually bordering on
complete incompetence. Instead of encouraging people to make hard
decisions and making choices that create effective, inexpensive systems,
I'm simply telling you that you can have what you want. In my job, this
is often referred to as doing a poor job of *managing expectations*.
