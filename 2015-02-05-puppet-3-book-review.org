I've been using Puppet for a couple of years now in a quick and dirty
way on a couple of side projects. Heck, I've even published a
couple of modules\_. I find it to be very easy to use and incredibly
useful.

Recently I wrote my first "real world" Django application and I wanted
to host it on a system that was provisioned using Puppet whenever it was
possible. I used Puppet extensively and it worked very well for me, but
it was clear that my current home-grown process for distributing my
manifests and modules just wasn't working. I had reached the point where
I actually needed to learn the patterns that people are using in the
real world to do what I was doing.

This book was exactly what I needed to introduce me to "proper" puppet
usage in a way that struck a good balance between simplicity and
usefulness. In 50 pages it highlighted all of the things that I would
need to learn in the medium term and how to configure them. And it did
so using a style that was a pleasure to read.

Please note that this isn't for everyone. For example:

-  It's only 50 pages long. If you're looking to become a Puppet expert
   after reading it, you're probably out of luck.
-  It expects you to set up a CentOS VM on which you can execute the
   examples from the book. This wasn't a big deal for me because I use
   Vagrant a lot, but if it's something that intimidates you then this
   book may be too advanced.

I can't believe that I've written such a verbose review of such a
concise book. Short version - *4/5 stars*.

* Extra Credit

If you do want to use Vagrant to create a VM for the examples then you
can create it using the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ cd /some/dir
    $ mkdir centos-image && cd centos-image
    $ vagrant init puppetlabs/centos-6.5-64-puppet
    $ vagrant up
#+END_EXAMPLE
