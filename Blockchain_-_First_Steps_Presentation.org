#+TITLE: "Practical Introduction To The Blockchain Using Ethereum" - Presentation

[[./images/waldo-with-ethereum.png]]

Do you want to learn more about "the blockchain" but don't know where
to start? Are you an experiential learner who prefers to learn by
doing? And would you prefer to learn without spending much money?

In the presentation below I go over "dipping your toes" into the
Ethereum blockchain for complete beginners. We cover:

- Setting up a wallet
- Buying and managing a cryptocurrency (Ether)
- Common gotchas

The goal is to teach you how to fish and "bootstrap" your own process
for learning about the blockchain. It's easy, fairly inexpensive and
very, very educational (the process, not the presentation). Also, if
you're lucky you can be the first kid on your block to own a
crypto-collectible.

Here's how I print it on my system to conserve paper:

1. Choose two-sided printing, *long edge*.
2. Choose the *landscape* orientation.
