I was a /huge/ fan of Conrad Barski's last book, *Land Of Lisp*. I
really like his writing style, which intersperses conventional writing
with the occasional comic, which are both done very well. I was
therefore very happy to see that his next book was going to cover
something that I've been experimenting with a bit lately - Bitcoin.

I am very fortunate to have a friend who gave me an excellent tutorial
on Bitcoins earlier this year. He showed me how to buy and spend them
and a little about how the network works. However, there's still a bunch
of stuff that's a mystery to me.

For example, what are my options for safely storing and backing up my
wallets? How could I use them to accept POS payments? And finally, how
is everything encrypted? This book includes all of that and quite a bit
more.

One more thing that I really loved about this book is that it seems to
target readers who at least know a little bit about programming and
encryption. There's even example programs at the end that show you how
run your own code against the blockchain.

The Bitcoin ecosystem currently lacks a lot of quality educational
resources. And what does exist seems to target mathematicians or people
who are looking to make a quick buck. Thankfully this book does a great
job filling that gap. If you're any sort of technologist who has any
interest in Bitcoins then check out this book soon.
