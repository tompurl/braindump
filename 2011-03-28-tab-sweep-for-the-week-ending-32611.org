*great* overview of all of your development and deployment options when
running a JRuby-powered web application. -
[[http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Hot-Swapping-Your-Engines-At-30000-Feet][InfoQ:
Hot Swapping Your Engines At 30,000 Feet]]This was an interesting
presentation on creating a modern, high-volume web site using
Java. Also, here are some links to some of the development tools that
were mentioned in the presentation: -
[[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/coherence/overview/index.html][Oracle
Coherence]]This is distributed cache software for java systems. -
[[http://www.sonarsource.org/][Sonar]]This is the software quality
checker program from the shopzilla presentation. -
[[https://code.google.com/p/javasimon][javasimon - Java Simon - Simple
Monitoring API - Google Project Hosting]]This appears to be software
that you can embed in your Java program to help you profile your code at
runtime. It was mentioned in the Shopzilla presentation. -
[[http://jamonapi.sourceforge.net/][JAMon - Documentation]]This appears
to be software that you can embed in your Java program to help you
profile your code at runtime. It was mentioned in the Shopzilla

   Deviation]]I'm trying to brush up on statistics again, and this guy's
   tutorials are a good place to start for those of us that didn't take
   enough math classes in college.

   keyboard layout « a little place of calm]]I use my keyboard a *lot*
   more than some other computer users because I use text editors and
   terminals a lot at my job. I therefore worry a bit about RSI, and
   switching keyboards may help me in the long term.
-  [[http://www.ehow.com/how_5043765_add-forms-iweb.html][How to Add
   Forms to Iweb | eHow.com]]A friend of mine asked how she could place
   "active" content inside of a static web site. I told her that she
   would probably need to go down the PHP or CGI route, but then we
   stumbled across this tutorial. It shows you how to use web
   applications such as [[http://jotform.com/][Jotform]] to create and
   embed forms in a static web site easily.
