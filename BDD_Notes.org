** Good steps are declarative, not imperative.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE -r
   Good steps are *declarative* in that they state what should happen at a high
   level, and not imperative because they shouldn’t focus on direct, low-level
   instructions.

   Imperative details shouldn't be included in the steps themselves - they should be
   included in the *step definitions*.
