* Installing The Latest Version Of Puppet On Debian 7

This is from the [[https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/instant-puppet-3-starter-instant|Instant Puppet 3 Starter]] book.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
    $ sudo dpkg –i puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get puppet
#+END_EXAMPLE

In my case, since I already had the "stock" Debian version of Puppet installed
I had to run the following command last:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
#+END_EXAMPLE
