#+TITLE: Mattermost-Hosting-Notes

These are my notes discussing Mattermost hosting with =@bgm= on the
Civicrm chat application (which is also hosted on Mattermost).

- It's fairly simple to install and maintain. He currently just untars
  the new version of the code over the old version.
- They're currently using a VM with 2 CPU's and a 2 GB of RAM and
  everything's running very well.
- They've been using it for a year.
- It doesn't use a ton of bandwidth, but it could if your users post a
  lot of attachments.
- They're only using 5 GB of disk space so far.
