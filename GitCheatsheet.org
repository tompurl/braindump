* Creating A New Remote For A Local Repo

This process is used when:

1. You have code on your local machine that is in a git repo.
2. This code is not currently pushed to a remote.
3. You want to store a remote on a different filesystem (e.g. a
   directory accessible over NFS or SSH).

In this example I'm pushing to a shared Windows drive.

#+BEGIN_SRC ps
  # Navigate to the location of where you want to store your code.
  cd \\some-server\share$\tom\git
  git init --bare dotemacs

  # Now navigate to your repo and push
  cd c:\users\tom\.emacs
  git remote add origin '\\some-server\share$\tom\git\dotemacs'
  git push --set-upstream origin master
  git push origin --mirror
#+END_SRC

Now you can backup your repo to a different server and even share your
code with others who have access to that shared directory.
