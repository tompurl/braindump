   This is a very cool announcement, and I'm anxious to see how popular
   this hosting options becomes.

   This is a great overview of why some people choose Jruby over Ruby,
   and it includes a very good example case.

   This little tip was a real life-saver for me once. The power and
   simplicity of the Korn shell never ceases to amaze me.

   This is just one of the coolest things I have seen in quite a while.
   You can even run a C compiler and Emacs instance in the Window. Stuff
   like this really makes you wonder what we'll be running in our
   browsers in the near future.

   I'm not sure if this announcement is pertinent to most Java admins,
   since the licensing terms are still a little foggy to me. However,
   what I hope is that this change will give Jboss admins another
   high-quaility JVM option.
