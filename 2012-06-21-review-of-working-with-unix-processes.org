Working with UNIX Processes by Jesse Storimer My rating: 4 of 5 stars
It's difficult for me to identify the target audience for this book.
It's got some good stuff for lots of different people, including systems
administrators, Unix scripters, and Ruby developers. In a nutshell, this
book gives you a medium-level tutorial on creating, managing, and
forking new processes on Unix-based systems. Specifically, the author
shows you how to use many powerful features of the Unix system API using
Ruby.This topic may sound mundane or even useless to a lot of people,
but if you spend time writing or managing applications that run in
operating systems like Linux and OS X, then this is really fantastic
knowledge to possess.One really wonderful thing about this book is that
it makes the Unix system API much more accessible to most systems
administrators. Most books about the Unix API assume that you know how
to program in C. The problem is that most systems administrators don't
know how to use C, and they don't really have an opportunity to learn on
the job.This book uses Ruby, a high-level, interpreted, and popular
scripting language to showcase the Unix API. In my opinion, this makes
the API much easier to understand and much less intimidating. Also, if
you don't know Ruby, then it is a) simple to learn and b) very
beneficial to learn due to its popularity.Another great thing about this
book is that it really "put a lot of pieces together" for me regarding
the Unix process model. I've been using Unix since 1995, and I've been
administering large applications on it for 12 years. I definitely
consider myself to be an intermediate user, but there's still a decent
number of gaps in my knowledge. This book filled a couple of those major
gaps for me, and I feel that I am a much more confident and
knowledgeable Unix user as a result.The only real downside of this book
is that it's a bit short for what you pay. The latest version of this
book weighs in at about 143 pages. Also, while the book does include a
sample project called Spyglass, its documented by a short appendix and
verbose comments in the source. I would have liked a little more depth
in the appendix, but it's hard to say if it's really necessary since the
comments are designed to be the tutorial.However, for me, this book was
still definitely worth the money. I now know much more about how Unix
systems work, and I now am aware of a whole new world of concurrent
programming options. View all my reviews
