#+TITLE: Standalone Puppet For Mere Mortals

* Outline

How I learned to use a server-free version of Puppet to simplify system
administration significantly.

Some points:

-  I always wanted to use puppet, but I didn't want to set up a puppet
   server.
-  My process for building a new server or laptop was error-prone, long
   and tedious.

* Content

I was recently setting up a new
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server][VPS]] and
thought that it would be great if I could configure everything using
Puppet\_. I've used Puppet a little bit\_ to set up Vagrant VM's, but
I've never actually used it to set up a laptop or a VPS because I never
had the time or inclination to set up a puppetmaster server.
