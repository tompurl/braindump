#+Title: New Blog Announcement - Shell Magic 

I'm excited to say that I am working on a series of screencasts that
target Unix command-line newbies. The series is called
[[http://shellmagic.wordpress.com][$hell Magic]], and it's my first
attempt at making screencasts. It was a lot of fun and surprisingly
simple to create my first one. If you would like to learn more about the
Unix or Linux command-line, or you know someone else who would, please
feel free to check it out.
