#+TITLE: Robot Framework Cheat Sheet

* Emacs
   Make sure that you create a ctags/etags file so you can use the [[help:robot-mode-find-kw][robot-mode-find-kw]]
   function to jump to a keyword's definition.

   On windows, I had the best luck with the Universal Ctags executable. Here's the
   command that I use at my project's root to generate my tags file for Emacs:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd project-root
     ctags.exe -e --langmap="Robot:.robot.txt" -R
   #+END_SRC
