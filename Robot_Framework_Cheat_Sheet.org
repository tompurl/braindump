#+TITLE: Robot Framework Cheat Sheet

* Emacs
   Make sure that you create a ctags/etags file so you can use the [[help:robot-mode-find-kw][robot-mode-find-kw]]
   function to jump to a keyword's definition.

   On windows, I had the best luck with the Universal Ctags executable. Here's the
   command that I use at my project's root to generate my tags file for Emacs:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd project-root
     ctags.exe -e --langmap="Robot:.robot.txt" -R
   #+END_SRC
* Debugging
** General
   This is an excellent reference:

   - https://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.robotframework/docs/source/debugging.html
** Dumping All Variable Values
   Use the following keyword to dump all of the existing variables:

   - =Log Variables    level=INFO=

   Please note that the =level= is VERY important. Just choose INFO and you'll see
   everything you care about.
