* Rebuilding The Index

First, make sure that no =minidlna= processes are running. This will
require checking the process table and manually killing pid's. Next,
run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

sudo minidlnad -R

#+END_EXAMPLE

This command will return immediately, even though it will take the
process at least a few minutes to run. Periodically check this process
until it's done.

Next, make sure that the database is owned by the minidlna user:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

sudo chown -R minidlna:minidlna /var/cache/minidlna/

#+END_EXAMPLE

Apparently even though the process has been stopped =systemd=
is confused at this point, so we have to run the following 
commands to start the process again:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

sudo systemctl stop minidlna.service
sudo systemctl start minidlna.service

#+END_EXAMPLE
