#+TITLE: What The Hell's An SSL Handshake And Why Doesn't It Work?

One of the most common and fundamental issues that I see in my line of
work is *SSL Handshake errors*. And since SSL[fn:1] and TLS are such complex
and poorly-documented subjects for non-PhD's, people often resort to
voodoo incantations and "what the last guy did that works sometimes"
to solve their problems.

The good news is that there's no black magic or PhD required to solve
most SSL handshake issues. In this article I'll explain what I do when
this issue occurs, but first let's look at the fundamentals.

* What's Happening When I Get This Error?

This error occurs when your sever does the following:

1. Your server tries to communicate with a remote server using HTTP and
   SSL (i.e. an =https://= url).
2. Your server does not trust the remote server.

That's it! What that all means is explained below at a
*very high level* :-)

#+BEGIN_NOTE
*Note*: The assumption in this tutorial is that you manage a server
that is having issues making HTTPS calls to a remote server. However,
a lot of the information below is useful for anyone who wants a
introduction on how TLS works with HTTP.

* Special Note For All You Skippers Out There 

[[./images/homer-math.gif]]

I know, I know, you probably want to skip this *but you shouldn't*!
You're saying "hey, I'm not a mathematician. I'm a technologist who
just wants to fix this one error and I have deadlines. Just tell me
what button to push!"

The problem is that with this issue, there really is no one button to
push. It's a /little/ more complicated than that, but you'll just have
to trust that I'll keep everything as applicable and brief as possible 😀

* A Quick Primer On Asymmetric Encryption

*Asymmetric encryption* is a big, $50 phrase that strikes fear into
the hearts of many, but it's really *not a big deal* from a high
level. When I think about it, I really like to relate it to symmetric
encryption, which is only a $25 phrase and a scheme with which you are
already very familiar.

*Symmetric encryption* is when you and at least one other party share 
a *key*. Party A can encrypt a message with that key and send it to 
Party B, and since they both have the same key Party B can decrypt it.
Easy peasy. 

This scheme has two problems:

1. Key distribution is *hard*. You have to be very secretive and the
   process doesn't scale well if lots of people need that key.
2. If someone steals you key (which isn't that hard since lots of
   people probably will have a copy) you're screwed. 

A credit card number is a lot like a secret key. It's a "shared
secret" between you and your bank that gives you the ability to make
purchases. And like a secret key, lots of people have to have a copy
of it and those people aren't always a) competent or b) virtuous. So
every once in a while the key is stolen and it's a *royal pain in the
butt* to *revoke the old key* (cancel your card) and *distribute a new
one* (get a new/credit card number).

To help mitigate the issues with symmetric encryption some very smart
people came up with a really great idea for a new encryption scheme:

1. Person A generates *two* keys, a *private key* and a *public key*.
2. She then distributes the *public key* to the world.
   1. Anyone can have a copy, even malicious parties.
3. She also ensures that the private key is *never* distributed and
   stored in a private place.
4. People who want to securely communicate with Person A then use the
   *public key to encrypt* the message.
5. Person A then uses her *private key to decrypt* the message.

4 and 5 are *really* fundamental, so let's say it again:

- You *encrypt* messages with a *public key*
- You *decrypt* messages with a *private key*

Asymmetric encryption therefore eliminates a lot of the problems that
we have with symmetric encryption:

1. Key distribution is *very safe*. You can share it with the world
   with no fear of anyone using it to hurt you because it can't be
   used to decrypt messages.
2. It's *much harder* for someone to steal your private key because
   only one person ever has to have a copy of it. It's therefore much
   easier to secure. 

* Now For A Quick Demo

So why is this important? Well, this scheme is what your browser (or
any HTTP client) uses to trust remote =https://= URL's. The remove
host (e.g. https://www.ebay.com) has the *private key* and your browser
or whatever has the *public key* [fn:2]. We can therefore have an encrypted
conversation.

So how can we see this in action? Well let's see how a browser
communicates with a a web site using HTTP+SSL.

On the server that hosts Ebay (https://www.ebay.com) there's a
private key that's referenced by the web server. You can't *see* this
*private key* because, well yeah, it's private. You just have to trust
that it's there because otherwise it wouldn't be able to use the
=https= handler.

Now based on everything I've said so far you know you need to have a
*copy of my public key* somewhere on your computer, right? Absolutely?
But where?

*Every HTTP client* (e.g. your web browser, =curl=, your server that's
calling a remote web service) that is capable of communicating using
SSL has to reference at least one *trust store* (which is often also
called a *key store*). What's a trust/key store? It's a "database" of
private and/or public keys. So the keys inside of it can can be used
to encrypt communication (using public keys) or decrypt communication
(using private keys).

If you were using Firefox the trust store is called a *certificate
manager*. You get to it by accessing *Preferences -> Privacy and
Security -> View Certificates* and then click on the *Authorities*
tab.

So what exactly are you looking at? These are *all of the public keys*
that are associated with sites that you trust. One of these files is
used to encrypt the communication with *www.ebay.com* that is decrypted
by the private key on that server. 

So go ahead. Scroll through the list and find the public key for
www.ebay.com. I can wait...

* Twist!

[[./images/what-a-twist.gif]]

At this point you may have noticed that there isn't any key with
*www.ebay.com* in the title. And you're completely right. The
public key for www.ebay.com isn't in your browser's trust store,
but your browser still trusts the site and can encrypt traffic that is
sent to it. How can that be if everything I've said so far is true?

Let's think about it for a minute. Let's imagine that you're using
Ebay for the first time.  Using the asymmetric scheme that I listed
above, you would need to do the following:

1. Visit the site and get an error stating that your browser doesn't
   trust it
2. Download Ebay's public key from a *3rd-party that we both trust*.
3. Install the public key in your browser's trust store
4. Visit the site without any errors.

Easy peasy, right? Well yeah, until you realize that you would need to
do this for *every single web host* that you visit at least once[fn:4]. So 
once for amazon.com, once for google.com, once for calendar.google.com,
et cetera.

We would also need some type of third party to distribute the public
keys for us that we both trusted. So, for example there could be a web
site (let's call it *certauth.com*) with all of the public keys.

But wait, how do we know that the *www.ebay.com* public key on
certauth.com is really associated with *www.ebay.com*. I don't want some
rando getting my credit card number. For that matter, how does
certauth.com know that the *www.ebay.com* public key is really from
Ebay?

* Certificate Authorities

Let's try another demo. The instructions below are for Firefox but
similar results can be obtained with any browser.

#+BEGIN_NOTE
*Note*: Terminology gets a bit slippery here, so please bare with
me. Public and private keys are also called *certificates*, and there
are different types:

- private key == *private certificate*
- public key == *signer certificate*

The different names will be used interchangeably below.
#+END_NOTE

1. Visit https://www.ebay.com
2. Left-click on the green lock icon in the URL bar.
3. Click on the right arrow (=>=) next to the *Secure Connection* label.
4. Next, click on the *More Information* button.
5. You should now see *Page Info* popup. Ensure that the *Security*
   button at the top is selected and then click on the *View
   Certificate* button.

You should now see a window that looks a lot like this:

[[./images/tls-pic-1.png]]

Wow, scary right? Don't worry about all of the fields, we only care 
about a few of them. 

Next, click on the *Details* tab. You should now see a window that
looks a lot like this:

[[./images/tls-pic-2.png]]

The *really important part* in that last screen shot is the
*Certificate Hierarchy* section. In it you see three certs, with the
www.ebay.com cert being at the bottom. What this shows you is the
following:

1. The *www.ebay.com* cert is trusted by the *Symantec Class 3 Secure
   Server CA - G4* cert (which is usually called your *intermediate
   cert*).
2. The *Symantec Class 3 Secure Server CA - G4* cert is then trusted
   by the *VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority*
   cert (which is usually called your *root cert*).

/Now/ if you look in your browser's trust store/certificate manager
you should see the intermediate and root certs above, but *no* cert for
www.ebay.com. So what's going on?

* Chain Of Trust

[[./images/trust-pound.gif]]

Remember before when I proposed the fictional "certauth.com" scheme
above for distributing public keys? It required mutually-trusted
3rd-parties to certify public keys for us so that we know that the
public key for www.ebay.com /really is/ from the Ebay corporation.
Also, the process was a bit of a pain because you needed to manually
download a site's public key the first time you visited it, for *every
single site*.

Well, the good news is that we don't have to use this process in real
life. Instead we use a scheme called the *Chain of Trust*, where we trust
the certs that trust www.ebay.com so that we /don't/ have to
explicitly trust www.ebay.com. And since *those* certs trust lots an
*lots* of other sites we only have to *explicitly* trust a small number
of certs to *implicitly trust hundreds or thousands of sites*.

Let me break this process down because it's a bit confusing:

1. Your HTTP client trusts the root and intermediate certs above
   explicitly.
2. Those certs are used to trust (i.e. *sign*) hundreds or thousands
   of other certs for sites like www.ebay.com, www.amazon.com, etc.
3. Because you trust the root and intermediate certs you *implicitly
   trust* all of the sites that use certs that are trusted by the root
   and intermediate certs.

So who are these groups that do nothing but manage public keys that
are used to trust other public keys? These organizations are called
*Certificate Authorities*. Their whole job is ensuring that when
someone asks them to trust a certificate for www.ebay.com that the
request is /actually coming from/ someone at Ebay.

* All Right, Back To My Broken Server

First let's go over what we've learned:

1. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption from a 60,000-foot level.
2. How to view all of the public keys/signer certs in your browser's
   trust/certificate store. 
3. How to view a site's cert and the certs in its hierarchy.
4. How we use Certificate Authorities and the Chain of Trust to make
   managing (i.e. trusting) certificates much, much easier than
   trusting each and every site individually. 

But as enlightening as that information may be you need to know how it
will help you make your Tomcat/WebSphere/Nginx/Whatever server trust an
external server. Well, lucky for you the process that we used above
is basically the same one you'll use.

** 1. Examine The Remote Site's Cert Hierarchy

Using your favorite web browser visit the URL that is causing your
server to throw an SSL Handshake error. Obtaining this URL is often
easier said than done because the error message doesn't usually
include it, but it can be acquired using tools like =tcpdump=. Consult
your server's docs for more details.

Once you've visited the URL in your browser check it's cert hierarchy.
What are the root and intermediate certs? Next, export *only* the
root and intermediate cert to your computer. 

You will probably also want to record the *SHA-1* and *SHA-256*
fingerprints of the root and intermediate certs. Lots of tools will
provide this information for you, and I'm a big fan of [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/keystore-explorer/][KeyStore
Explorer]].

** 2. Import the Root And Intermediate Certs Into Your App Server's Trust Store

While it is *very* unusual for someone to import certs into their
browser's trust store it's a fairly common task on an application
server because it simply contains fewer signer certs by default. 

First we need to determine into which trust store should you import
your signer certs?  Here are some things to consider:

1. Each OS has a different set of tools and processes to manage
   host-specific certs.
2. Each application server (e.g. Apache, Nginx, WebSphere, Tomcat,
   etc.) manages trust stores a bit differently, often using slightly
   different terminology.
   1. For example, WebSphere Application Server can use more than 20
      different trust stores, including the JVM's =cacerts= file. Some
      of these trust stores are called key stores because they are
      only intended to contain private certs.
3. Client-server terminology can also confuse things. Even though your
   application server is a server it is also an *HTTP client* because
   it's calling a web service on a remote server.
   1. Your server typically manages two types of certificates:
      1. *Private certs*: These are private keys that your server uses
         to decrypt traffic from clients.
      2. *Signer certs*: These are public keys that your server uses
         when communicating as an *HTTP client* to remote servers.

Phew! My advice is to find the *canonical method* for added signer certs to
your server's trust store.

#+BEGIN_NOTE
*Note*: I have to recommend KeyStore Explorer again for the task of
inspecting and changing trust stores. The server-side tools can often
be very clunky, especially when you're trying to troubleshoot
cert-related issues.
#+END_NOTE

** 3. Test!

Hooray! This should fix your SSL Handshake errors. If not then I
recommend checking the SHA-1 fingerprint of the root and signer certs
that you exported and what you actually have in your trust store. 

* This Shit Isn't Easy

Wow, that was a lot to "take in" in one blog post, and I don't mean to
pretend that it's easy. You're definitely going to need to go through
the entire process of inspecting and adding certs multiple times
before it will start to make any sense.

Good luck with your SSL journey!

* Synonym Mappings

One more thing. I use *a lot* of terms above interchangeably. Here's a
handy map just in case things get confusing:

| Term 1            | Term 2              |
|-------------------+---------------------|
| Certificate       | Cert                |
| Private Key       | Private Certificate |
| Public Key        | Signer Certificate  |
| Key Store         | Trust Store[fn:3]   |
| Certificate Store | Trust or Key Store  |
|                   |                     |

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Please note that no one is using SSL any more and everyone is
using TLS. However, everyone still calls TLS SSL, and most errors that
you'll get will call it SSL instead of TLS. So for the purposes of
this document we'll use the two terms interchangeably. 

[fn:2] There's a catch to this that I'll explain soon.

[fn:3] I know, I know, you're not supposed to /use/ them the same way
but technically they're the same type of database.

[fn:4] And that doesn't even take certificate revocation into account,
which we won't even cover in this tutorial.
