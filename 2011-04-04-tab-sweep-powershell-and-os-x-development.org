#+Title: Tab Sweep - Powershell And OS X Development 

-  Powershell Links

   -  One of my development goals for the year is to become very
      proficient with Microsoft's Powershell. I usually have a cmd.exe
      window open at all times on my Windows machine, so I replaced it
      with a Powershell window and used the following tutorials to help
      me make the transition.

      -  This video was actually a *major* pain to watch and download.
         I sure wish that Microsoft was better at publishing video
         tutorials.

      -  This is what you need to install to get the actual Powershell
         2.0 executable.

   -  This guy is can exaggerate a bit sometimes, but he has some great
      nuggets of wisdom in his blog. I don't think I agree that OS X is
      unsuitable for development, but it certainly has some downsides
      that you rarely hear about.
