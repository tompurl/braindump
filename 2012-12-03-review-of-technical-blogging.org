This is a good book for pretty much anyone who wants to improve the
popularity of their blog in a substantive way. It basically shows you
how to set up a blog, write quality content, and the promote it. And
after all of that, if you also want to make some money off of your blog,
there's tons of good advice.

The best part of this book is that it is written from the perspective of
someone who has a *lot* of knowledge. The author has created numerous,
commercially-viable blogs on a variety of subjects. This knowledge and
experience really shows, especially when he is able to share actual
statistics and financial records from his sites.

Another thing I really like about this book is that it is very
non-sleazy. The world is full of people trying to show you how to game
the system to get a few more clicks on your site. This book instead
focuses on *quality content* and *ethical marketing*.

Overall, I give this book a *4 out of 5*. If you don't know much about
marketing your blog, then get it right away. If you've been doing it a
while, then definitely read it eventually.
