#+TITLE: Migrating Vimwiki Content From 1.x To 2.x Using Vim

#+DATE: 2014-02-27 21:00

I'm a huge fan of the [[https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki][vimwiki]]
plugin for documenting my daily tasks at work and home. It's quick,
powerful, easy to use, and I love how easy it is to share my notes with
others. I started using it in December 2011 and I've probably used it
almost every day since.

The version of the plugin that I started using was 1.2, and shortly
after I started using it they updated it to 2.0. This new version had
some nice new features (like limited Markdown support) but they also
made changes to the default markup language. This was a disappointment
for me because I already had hundreds of documents that used the old
format. Converting everything seemed like a pain, so I just kept on
using the 1.2 version of the plugin.

I finally made the jump to the latest (2.2) version of vimwiki this week
and I was surprised by the following:

1. It was very easy. I had all of my content converted in less than 30
   minutes.
2. I was able to perform all of the find and replace operations *using
   only Vim*. This was an especially nice feature since I also had to
   make a lot of changes on a Windows-based system on which =sed= was
   not installed.

Here's how I did it.

* Caveat

Please *first backup your wiki content before making any of the changes
listed below*. It's quick and easy and a Good Idea every time you think
about making any large-scale changes.

* Converting Wiki Links With Descriptions

I had a *lot* of wiki links in my documents that looked like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [[HowToRestartServer][How To Restart Server]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the wiki I would see *How To Restart Server* as the name of the link,
but the file would be saved as =HowToRestartServer.wiki=. This is nice
because I like to have easy-to-read titles but I don't like spaces in my
file names.

However, the 2.x version of the wiki markup language requires the
following format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [[HowToRestartServer|How To Restart Server]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Making this change from Vim was actually very easy. First, I ran my
search-and-replace command in one wiki document to test it out:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    :%s/\]\[/\|/g
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a *regular expression* that is basically saying thanks
following:

-  Find all instance of ']['
-  Replace it with '|'
-  Do it to every match that you find in this document

This worked well in that document so I applied it to every document in
my wiki. To do that, I first added all of my wiki documents to my
*argument list*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    :argadd /my/wiki/path/*.wiki
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now I could run my find and replace command against all of the documents
in my wiki with a few minor modifications:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    :argdo %s/\]\[/\|/ge | update
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Fixing Embedded Images

I also had a *lot* of embedded images in my wiki pages. I used the
following format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [[./Images/1-15-2014 3-00-01 PM.jpg]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

This markup creates an =<a href>= tag that points at my =Images=
directory that is directly beneath my =wiki_html= directory.

The new markup to display the same image in the 2.x version of vimwiki
looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    {{local:../wiki_html/Images/1-15-2014 3-00-01 PM.jpg}}
#+END_EXAMPLE

The script that converts your wiki markup to HTML now starts relative to
the =wiki= folder, *NOT* the =wiki_html= folder. We therefore have to go
up one folder to find the =wiki_html= folder and then we can reference
the =Images= folder. And there are of course a few other minor
differences.

The required regular expression to update this markup is a little more
complex. Just like in the previous example, I developed the regex
pattern in one document at first, and here's what I came up with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    :%s/\v\[\[\.(.*)\]\]/\{\{local:\.\.\/wiki_html\1\}\}/g
#+END_EXAMPLE

This looks crazy, but here's what it says:

-  =/\v=: This is a switch that uses Vim's "very special" regex mode.
   What this basically means is that you can avoid too many crazy escape
   sequences and just create a pattern that looks a lot like what you
   would use with =sed= or =perl=.
-  =\[\[\.(.*)\]\]=: Find everything between the =[[= and =]]= character
   sequences and put it in a *group*. We want that text to be in a group
   so we can use it later.
-  =\{\{local:\.\.\/wiki_html\1\}\}=: Replace the character sequence
   with one that looks like this:

   -  ={{local:../wiki_html= + contents of our first (and only) group +
      =}}=

This worked in my test document, so I used the same steps that I used
above:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    :argadd /my/wiki/path/*.wiki
    :argdo %s/\v\[\[\.(.*)\]\]/\{\{local:\.\.\/wiki_html\1\}\}/ge | update
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Additional Help

-  [[http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/31.html][Chapter
   31 of Learn Vim Script The Hard Way]] is a fantastic introduction to
   finding text based on regular expressions. Oh and it's free :-)
