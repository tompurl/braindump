Title: Switch To Jekyll Comments: true Category: Review

For the 3 people who may notice, I switched my blog from Wordpress to
[[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][Jekyll]]. The conversion has been a
fun experience, because it gave me the opportunity to "roll my own"
website instead of relying on the good people at
[[http://wordpress.com][Wordpress.com]] to do everything for me.

I hope to write a blog about the entire conversion soon. But in the mean
time, if you notice anything strange or have any problems, then I would
really appreciate it if [[mailto:tom@tompurl.com][you would drop me a
line]].

Enjoy!
