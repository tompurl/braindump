Nygard]] My rating: [[http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/97762352][5
of 5 stars]] I need to start by saying that this is one of the best
technical books I have ever read. To me, it's easily as enjoyable and
useful as [[http://cc2e.com/][Code Complete]],
[[http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer][The Pragmatic
Programmer]], or
[[http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959][The
Mythical Man Month]]. If you're a sysadmin, an architect, or a developer
that works with medium-to-large-sized systems, then do the following: 1.
Stop reading this 2. Order this book from your library or buy it from
The Pragmatic Programmer's web site 3. Owe me a pint :D

*What The Book Is Really About* Actually, there is one thing that I
don't like about this book, but it really has nothing to do with the
book. The description of this book on the Pragmatic Programmer's web
site sucks. It's vague, and it really gives the potential reader a tiny
amount of insight into the book's contents. What it should have said is
that this book contains *tons* of great information on designing,
deploying, maintaining and /improving/ medium-to-large-sized IT systems.
It's filled with patterns, anti-patterns, and general best practices
that should be part of the shared lexicon of every developer,
administrator, and system architect. Also, it does a good job of giving
you enough information to be useful without boring you to death. And
finally, it's written very well and is a joy to read. *The Highlights*
/Thread Dumps & Garbage Collection Tuning/ The internals of the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) have been a black box to me for the majority of my
career in IT. Thankfully, this book has provided excellent examples of
how you can troubleshoot and improve your system using tools that
interrogate and manipulate a JVM at runtime. For me, this was the most
interesting and useful part of the book, and I am looking forward to
seeing what can be gained by tuning and "poking at" the JVM's that are
in the system that I maintain. /Patterns and Anti-Patterns/ It's great
to finally find a book that codifies some patterns that administrators
and architects can use. /Transparency/ I thought that I new a lot about
monitoring and transparency before reading this book, but now I know
better. I especially like the concept of a unified "OpsDB", and I am
eager to build something like this myself for the system that I
maintain. /Integration Point Risks/ I always knew that integration
points (e.g. data feeds, databases, LDAP providers, etc.) added risk to
you system, but the author does a great job calculating the actual risk.
Also, he shows you many ways in which you can avoid brittle integration
points. *Caveats* I have one warning about this book, but it's
half-hearted. This book is what I would all Java-centric. All of the
case studies involve systems that are written in Java, and some of the
sections will only apply directly to you if you are working with
Java-based software. But does that mean that you should avoid this book
if you are working with Ruby, PHP, or .Net-based software? Absolutely
not. Even though there are a few small sections of the book that won't
directly apply to your line of work, most of them will apply in an
indirect way, regardless of your platform. And the other 94% of the book
will directly apply to medium-to-large systems of every stripe.
