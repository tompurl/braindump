#+TITLE: Quick Træfik Presentation And Demo

I gave a quick presentation on Træfik today at the [[https://www.meetup.com/FoxValleyLUG/events/244053775/][October meeting of
the Fox Valley Linux User Group]]. There's no recording but the
presentation is available here:

I've been waiting for a tool like Træfik for a while and I've already
found a few places where I can put it to good use. I hope to blog
about it more soon.
