* Mounting And Unmounting File Volumes

Let's say that you inspect an =.img= file using a command like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

$ file foobackup.img
foobackup.img: LUKS encrypted file, ver 1 [aes, xts-plain64, sha1] UUID: d57de975-af81-4f77-b770-4abcdbogus8a

#+END_EXAMPLE

You would mount it with the following commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

$ sudo cryptsetup luksOpen ./foobackup.img foobackup
Enter passphrase for foobackup.img: 
$ mkdir /tmp/foobackup # or whatever
$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/foobackup /tmp/foobackup

#+END_EXAMPLE

That's it. Once you're done with the partition, you can unmount it
like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

$ sudo umount /tmp/foobackup
$ sudo cryptsetup luksClose foobackup

#+END_EXAMPLE
