Title: The True Cost Of A Cutting-Edge Gadget Tags:

I read a great article on the
[[http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/][Freakonomics Blog]] today
regarding the opportunity costs associated with financially free
software updates: -

Much Does a Free iPhone Update Cost?]]

In it, the author basically points out that his financially free iPhone
update cost him one hour of his life when the update broke his phone. A
lot of the commentors on the blog stated that exchanging an unexpected
hour of your time for an up-to-date iPhone is /totally/ worth it, but
most of those people are, in my opinion, probably either lonely and sad
or too young to properly value their time. I have more than a few
electronic devices in my home that require periodic updates, so I'm very
familiar with this type of story. I've gotten to the point where I just
automatically budget time for any type of update that I do. This time
budgeting is important because it allows me to truly contemplate how
much each little update will "cost" both myself and my family. What I've
found to be even more important when it comes to valuing my time,
however, is budgeting for updates and other administrative overhead
/before/ I acquire a new gadget or piece of software. And since the
amount of time performing ongoing maintenance can quickly dwarf the
amount of time required to set up a new gadget, you need to account for
them both *along with* financial costs when you consider acquiring new
hardware or software. Let's look at cell phone choices as an example. I
use a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6101][Nokia 6101]], which I
purchased without any phone contract-related subsidies for around $50.
It's small, is incredibly simple to administer (no explicit patching and
/very/ little configuration), can receive e-mail, and can also be synced
with my calendar and contacts. There are some things that I wish it had,
like a larger display, and there are a few things I wish I could do with
it, such as send e-mail. However, even though I'm a very connected
person from a communications perspective, I find that this phone really
meets all of my functional requirements very well. The icing on the cake
is that *it just works* (to borrow a line from Apple): I turn it on, put
it in my pocket, and forget about it. Now, there's no denying that the
iPhone is a significantly nicer piece of hardware, and it contains
significantly nicer software. It has a large display, a powerful and
extensible user interface, and is web-enabled. It truly appears to be
the future of smart phones. The problem is that, with enhanced
functionality comes increased complexity, and this grouping usually ends
up costing you time. The iPhone OS, core, and third-party applications
must all be explicitly updated, and sometimes this action requires
multiple interfaces. More "moving parts" (from a software perspective of
course) means more points of failure, which means you spend more time
troubleshooting and fixing your phone. Ideally, something as important
and integral to our daily lives as a cell phone should transcend its
status as a electronic gadget. It should be so reliable and idiot proof,
that you focus on what you want to do, not on how it will be
accomplished. If your phone satisfies this requirement, then you should
be able to say something like "if I need you while I'm at the store,
I'll call you using my cell phone". Notice that I didn't specify my
phone's brand, it's communication protocol, or whether last night's
iTunes update deleted all of my ringer profiles. Of course, I'm looking
forward to the day when it will be practical for me to own a smart
phone, and, from a functional perspective, the iPhone seems like a great
piece of engineering. I'm just going to wait until it's financial and
opportunity costs are more in line with my budget.
