Review Comments: true

I apologize in advance for the corny, rhyming title :)

I've been using an
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC#Eee_900_series][Asus EEE PC
900]] netbook for about a year now, and have used it mostly for light
word processing and web browsing. I also have a
[[http://www.mythtv.org/][MythTV]] server running in my basement on an
old Duron-based system. I can do almost all of my personal daily work on
the EEE PC, but when I need to do anything MythTV-related, I'm forced to
switch machines.

This can be a pain, so I decided to try running the "frontend" for
MythTV on my EEE PC. To my surprise, everything is working /very/ well.
It only took me about 5 minutes to install and configure the frontend
software, and after that, I was able to do the following on my netbook:

-  Watch live tv
-  Watch recorded shows
-  Edit shows (i.e. cut out commercials)

And the best part is that it's all working very well over my wireless G
network. Your results may vary, but at least it's nice to know that this
configuration works for some people.

Here's some more information about my setup in case you want to try this
yourself:

-  My netbook has a 900 Mhz processor, 1 GB of RAM, and a solid-state
   hard drive
-  I am using the integrated graphics card made by Intel. Apparently, it
   uses the i810 chipset.
-  I am serving up standard-definition television

And finally, a few caveats:

-  I don't know the limits of the video card that comes with my netbook.
   The highest resolution that I've tried is 1280x1024 on a 17" monitor,
   and it looked pretty good. I have no idea how it would look at a
   higher resolution on a more regular-sized TV.
-  I have heard that his netbook simply can't display HD recordings. I'm
   not an expert on this type of thing (since I don't have an HD TV or
   monitor), however.
-  As with any hardware purchase, don't buy anything based solely on a
   blog or product review. This system worked well for me, but it could
   work terribly for you for a variety of reasons. Do a decent amount of
   research /before/ you spend any money. For example, the
   [[http://www.mythtv.org/wiki][MythTV wiki]] and
   [[http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-users/][mailing
   list]] are great places to do exactly this type of research.
