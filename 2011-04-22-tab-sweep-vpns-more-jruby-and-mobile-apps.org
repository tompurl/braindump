   -  I really believe that tablets and other "smart" devices are going
      to make a big splash in the corporate environment very soon.
      Learning how this stuff works inside and out may be a very smart

   -  Now that I have a smart phone, internet access has become
      ubiquitous, so I'm looking for a way to easily connect to my
      private network at home. This looks like a decent way of doing so.
