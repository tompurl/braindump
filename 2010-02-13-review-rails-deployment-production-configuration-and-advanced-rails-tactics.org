[[http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/88022716][4 of 5 stars]] Overall,
this book had a lot of very good information, and it was very helpful to
me as I deployed my first Ruby-On-Rails application into a "Production"
environment. Here's the high points: - Lots of good information on tools
such as [[http://www.capify.org/][Capistrano]], MySQL,
[[http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/][Mongrel]], Apache, and
[[http://nginx.net/][nginx]]. - The authors clearly know what they are
talking about. - It's helpful if you're deploying a "toy" application
(like I am) *and* if you're deploying a large, clustered application. -
It doesn't assume that you're already an expert on either Web app
deployment or Ruby-On-Rails.

Here are some of the things that could be better: - This book was
published over a year ago, and it already feels out-of-date. For
example, there isn't one mention of [[http://www.modrails.com/][Phusion
Passenger]], even though this tool seems to be the new standard app
server for Ruby-On-Rails in Production environments. - This is very
subjective, but I feel like the information could have been organized a
little better. I felt as if the author jumped around a bit sometimes. -
Also, some of the passages were a little difficult to read due to their
incorrect sentence structure. My writing isn't perfect either, but I
believe that the editor should have fixed more of these mistakes.

If you're deploying a Ruby app in any setting, then this is a good book
to get. I just don't know if I would actually buy it.
